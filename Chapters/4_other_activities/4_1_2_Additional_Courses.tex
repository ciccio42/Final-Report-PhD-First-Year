% \subsection{Additional Courses}
% I decided to add the following two exams to my path:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Mobile Robots for Critical Mission. The course, related to the Master Degree in Computer Engineering, aims to provide the architectural, methodological, and design elements for the realization of intelligent robots capable of moving autonomously in indoor environment. The course ended with the design, implementation, and validation of a software that allows a mobile robot platform to move autonomously, given the desired start and end points.
%     \item Ottimizzazione. The course aims to present the theoretical aspects related to both continuous and integer linear programming problems, combined with the respective solving algorithms.
% \end{itemize}
