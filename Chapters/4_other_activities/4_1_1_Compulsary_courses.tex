\subsection{Compulsary Courses}
The mandatory courses supported were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Funding and Management of Research Project}. The course primarily emphasizes three aspects related to Research Projects: how to secure funding for a research project, how to craft a research proposal to obtain a grant, and how to effectively manage a project once the funding has been secured. First, the course introduced the European funding programs and their associated evaluation criteria. Particular attention was given to the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA), specifically the Post-Doctoral Fellowship. Subsequently, the course covered project management methodologies, starting with an overview of project phases and the project life cycle, and concluding with concepts related to cost and risk management. Towards the conclusion of the course, we were tasked with composing a proposal for the MSCA Post-Doctoral Fellowship as the first part of the assignment, and a Project Management Plan and a First Year Report as the second part.
    \item \textit{Exploitation of Research Results}. The course is dedicated to presenting two strategies for leveraging research outcomes: the establishment of spin-off ventures and the creation of patents. In the initial segment, the regulations and methodologies employed to initiate a university spin-off have been presented. The subsequent section delves into the processes involved in crafting a patent. As a final activity, we were asked to prepare a proposal for a potential spin-off venture.
