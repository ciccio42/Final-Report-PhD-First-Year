\subsection{International Conference as presenting author and Paper as corresponding author}
In the second year of our project, we did not produce any scientific publications for either conferences or journals. Nonetheless, because our initial findings presented intriguing insights, we are in the process of preparing a paper for the ``European Robotic Forum 2024" (ERF 2024), scheduled to take place in Rimini, Italy from March 13 to 15, 2024. The submission deadline for scientific materials is set for November 1, 2024.
In addition, we have intentions to expand and validate our current experiments, with the aim of creating another publication in reputable journals like ``IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters" (RA-L).
