\section{Other Activities}
In conjunction with my primary research project centered on Robotic Learning from Demonstration, I was involved in a second research activity related to \textit{\textbf{Graph Representational Learning}} (GRL). GRL, which is a subfield of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, is dedicated to obtain valuable information from data structured in the form of graphs. This approach to data representation finds relevance in diverse domains, including but not limited to Recommendation Systems, Social Network Analysis, and Biological Networks, among others.

Under the supervision of Professor Pasquale Foggia and Professor Vincenzo Carletti, I directed my focus toward the topic of Anomaly Detection within the context of Internet-of-Things Device Networks. Our research aims to propose novel architectures and innovative learning paradigms to dynamically analyze such networks. The ultimate objective is to discern whether a subset of devices exhibits anomalous behaviors, an indicative sign that could potentially indicate the presence of cyber-attacks in progress. This pursuit not only enriches the field of Graph Representational Learning but also holds profound implications for the cybersecurity landscape.
