\chapter{Preliminary Results}
\label{chapter:preliminary_results}
This chapter is dedicated to presenting the outcomes achieved during the second year of my PhD endeavor. While the initial year was primarily focused on the comprehensive study of Machine Learning and Deep Learning fundamentals, coupled with an extensive review of the literature on Learning From Demonstration as detailed in Chapter \ref{chapter:background}, the second year marked a significant shift in focus. It was dedicated to the development of the actual research proposal, building upon the hypotheses introduced in Chapter \ref{chapter:research_plan}.

More specifically, Section \ref{sec:dataset_description} offers an in-depth description of the dataset employed throughout the experimental phase, providing essential context for the ensuing research. Meanwhile, Section \ref{sec:experiment_results} provides a detailed exposition of the most pertinent findings and results obtained during this second year.
