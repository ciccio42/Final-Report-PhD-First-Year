\chapter{Research Plan}
\label{chapter:research_plan}
This chapter will present the research project. Specifically, the discussion will begin with a description of the various research gaps that can be extrapolated from the current literature and the importance of addressing these gaps with respect to the ultimate goals of Learning from Demonstration (Section \ref{sec:research_gaps}). Next, the research proposal for the next two years will be presented, contextualizing it within the previous study and highlighting its strengths and importance (Section \ref{sec:research_activity}). Along with the presentation of the project, the techniques and methodologies used to implement the project and evaluate the results obtained will also be described.
